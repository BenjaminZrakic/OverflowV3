Flowers bloom here
A rare sight around here, these days
They blossom from each thought you have
Each creation you could have made
But didnâ€™t have the guts to
Or was it a lack of time?
A lack of passion?
Now horrors feed off of what could have been yours
Will you let them have their way
Or will you crush them 
Like the bugs you always knew they were
