Ah, you're finally up...
No, not like that silly.
Welcome to the land of dreams.
You're lucid.
And you cannot wake up.
Many fears haunt you while you're awake.
They bleed through the walls of your mind.
Did you really think it was going to be so simple?
They say there's no way out.
But can you find it?
