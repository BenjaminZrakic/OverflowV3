Ah...
The rationale of the human mind...
A great gift, but even yet...
A greater curse...
What unimaginable horrors have come from these depths...
Created by the cogs turning incessantly...
Never stopping to stop thinking of the consequences...
Never stopping to just...
Think.
Do you think you can stop them instead?
